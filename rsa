Finding the prime factors of a large number can be a computationally expensive task, especially for large numbers. The time taken to find the prime factors depends on the size of the number and the efficiency of the algorithm used.

For example, the best-known classical algorithm for factorization is the General Number Field Sieve (GNFS), which has a time complexity of approximately O(exp((64/9)^(1/3) * (ln n)^(1/3) * (ln ln n)^(2/3))), where n is the number to be factored. This algorithm can factor numbers with hundreds of digits, but it can take a long time even for numbers with fewer digits.

In practice, the security of RSA relies on the fact that factoring large numbers is computationally infeasible. RSA keys are typically 2048 or 4096 bits long, which makes them very secure against classical factorization algorithms.

Given these considerations, it is unlikely that any program could reliably find the prime factors of a large RSA number in less than 5 seconds, especially without using any external libraries or tools. However, for small RSA numbers (e.g., with 8-10 digits), it may be possible to find the prime factors using efficient algorithms such as the Pollard's p-1 algorithm or the elliptic curve factorization method.
